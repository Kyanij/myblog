#### Hi,

My name is Foo Bar and people call me by my nick name _Foo_. I am an avid blogger. 
I have been fortunate so far for being the programmer's favourite name
as placeholder for naming various _Variables, Functions, Commands_ or other
programming entities. I found that their main purpose is to demonstrate a concept
rather than giving importance to any identity.
